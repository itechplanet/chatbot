#Bot project..

This is a basic web api built with the mean stack for a chatbot backend. This chatbot will be able to retrieve employee details from the mongo db. Employees will also be able to apply for leave through the chatbot. You just have to share/expose the api endpoints for the chatbot to communicate with it.
